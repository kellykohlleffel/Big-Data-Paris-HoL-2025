A Fivetran and Cortex-powered Streamlit in Snowflake data application for Customer Retention Optimization with advanced AI Agent Workflows.

## Overview

ChurnGuard is an intelligent customer retention system that helps companies automate the manual and time-consuming process of analyzing customer behavior, engagement patterns, and churn risk indicators. This Streamlit in Snowflake data application helps Marketing Managers, Chief Marketing Officers, and Customer Service Representatives reduce customer churn rates, improve customer engagement, and optimize retention strategies through real-time analysis of customer relationship data.

The application features sophisticated AI Agent Workflows that provide transparent, step-by-step analysis of customer retention data, transforming complex churn prediction models and engagement optimization strategies into actionable customer insights and personalized retention recommendations. Each analysis focus area operates through specialized mini-agents that simulate the decision-making process of experienced marketing managers and customer retention experts.

The application utilizes a synthetic customer dataset that simulates data from CRM platforms, usage analytics systems, and social media monitoring services. This synthetic data is moved into Snowflake using a custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK, enabling reliable and efficient data pipelines for customer retention analytics.
