A Fivetran and Cortex-powered Streamlit in Snowflake data application for Hospitality Guest Experience Optimization with advanced AI Agent Workflows.

## Overview

LocalLink is an intelligent guest services system that helps hotels automate the manual and time-consuming process of analyzing guest preferences, local venue data, and real-time availability patterns. This Streamlit in Snowflake data application helps Guest Services Managers, Chief Experience Officers, and Concierge Staff reduce guest service inefficiencies, optimize local partnership revenue, and enhance guest satisfaction through real-time analysis of hospitality and local venue data.

The application features sophisticated AI Agent Workflows that provide transparent, step-by-step analysis of guest experience data, transforming complex local recommendation models and guest satisfaction optimization strategies into actionable insights and personalized guest service recommendations. Each analysis focus area operates through specialized mini-agents that simulate the decision-making process of experienced concierge professionals and guest relations managers.

The application utilizes a synthetic hospitality dataset that simulates data from guest preference systems, local venue platforms, and booking management services. This synthetic data is moved into Snowflake using a custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK, enabling reliable and efficient data pipelines for guest experience analytics.
