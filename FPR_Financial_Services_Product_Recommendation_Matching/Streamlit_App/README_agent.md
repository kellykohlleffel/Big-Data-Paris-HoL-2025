A Fivetran and Cortex-powered Streamlit in Snowflake data application for Financial Services with advanced AI Agent Workflows.

## Overview

FinMatch is an AI-driven financial product matching system that helps financial institutions provide personalized product recommendations to their customers. This Streamlit in Snowflake data application helps retail banking managers, product managers, and customer experience teams increase product sales, reduce customer churn, and improve customer satisfaction through real-time analysis of customer data.

The application features sophisticated AI Agent Workflows that provide transparent, step-by-step analysis of financial product matching data, transforming complex banking insights into actionable customer engagement and product recommendation strategies. Each analysis focus area operates through specialized mini-agents that simulate the decision-making process of experienced retail banking professionals and financial product strategists.

The application utilizes a synthetic financial dataset that simulates data from major core banking systems, CRM platforms, and transaction logs. This synthetic data is moved into Snowflake using a custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK, enabling reliable and efficient data pipelines for financial services analytics.
