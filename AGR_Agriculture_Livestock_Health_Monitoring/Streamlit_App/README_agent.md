A Fivetran and Cortex-powered Streamlit in Snowflake data application for Agriculture with advanced AI Agent Workflows.

## Overview

Livestock Health Guardian is an AI-driven livestock health monitoring system that helps agricultural operations automate the early detection and prevention of livestock health issues, reducing the risk of disease outbreaks and improving overall animal welfare. This Streamlit in Snowflake data application helps farm managers, veterinarians, and livestock owners reduce treatment failures, decrease veterinary costs, increase animal productivity, and reduce antibiotic usage through real-time analysis of livestock health and environmental data.

The application features sophisticated AI Agent Workflows that provide transparent, step-by-step analysis of agricultural data, transforming complex livestock monitoring insights into actionable farm management strategies. Each analysis focus area operates through specialized mini-agents that simulate the decision-making process of agricultural experts.

The application utilizes a synthetic agriculture dataset that simulates data from farm management software, livestock health records, and weather monitoring systems. This synthetic data is moved into Snowflake using a custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK, enabling reliable and efficient data pipelines for agricultural livestock monitoring analytics.
