![Livestock Health Guardian](images/livestock_health_guardian.png)

A Fivetran and Cortex-powered Streamlit in Snowflake data application for Agriculture.

## Overview

Livestock Health Guardian is an AI-driven livestock health monitoring system that helps agricultural operations automate the early detection and prevention of livestock health issues, reducing the risk of disease outbreaks and improving overall animal welfare. This Streamlit in Snowflake data application helps farm managers, veterinarians, and livestock owners reduce treatment failures, decrease veterinary costs, increase animal productivity, and reduce antibiotic usage through real-time analysis of livestock health and environmental data.

The application utilizes a synthetic agriculture dataset that simulates data from farm management software, livestock health records, and weather monitoring systems. This synthetic data is moved into Snowflake using a custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK, enabling reliable and efficient data pipelines for agricultural livestock monitoring analytics.

## Data Sources

The application is designed to work with data from major agricultural and livestock management systems:

### Agriculture Data Sources (Simulated)
- **Farm Management Software**: 
  - Granular
  - Trimble Ag
  - Climate FieldView
- **Livestock Health Records**: 
  - Zoetis
  - Merck Animal Health
  - Elanco
- **Weather Data**: 
  - The Weather Company
  - AccuWeather
  - DTN

For demonstration and development purposes, we've created a synthetic dataset that approximates these data sources and combined them into a single table exposed through an API server. This approach allows for realistic agricultural livestock monitoring analytics without using proprietary farm operations data.

## Key Features

- **AI-driven livestock health monitoring**: Leverages generative AI to analyze animal health data and automatically generate health assessments with predictive insights
- **Integration with synthetic agriculture data**: Simulates data from major farm management platforms, livestock health systems, and weather monitoring services
- **Comprehensive data application**: Visual representation of key metrics including health risk scores, animal weights, environmental conditions, and vaccination status
- **AI-powered insights**: Generate in-depth analysis of overall performance, optimization opportunities, financial impact, and strategic recommendations
- **Custom Fivetran connector**: Utilizes a custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK to reliably move data from the API server to Snowflake

## Setup Instructions

1. Within Snowflake, click on **Projects**
2. Click on **Streamlit**
3. Click the blue box in the upper right to create a new Streamlit application
4. On the next page:
   - Name your application
   - **IMPORTANT:** Set the database context
   - **IMPORTANT:** Set the schema context

### Fivetran Data Movement Setup

1. Ensure the API server hosting the synthetic agriculture data is operational
2. Configure the custom Fivetran connector (built with Fivetran Connector SDK) to connect to the API server - debug and deploy
3. Start the Fivetran sync in the Fivetran UI to move data into an `AGR_RECORDS` table in your Snowflake instance
4. Verify data is being loaded correctly by checking the table in Snowflake

## Data Flow

1. **Synthetic Data Creation**: A synthetic dataset approximating real agricultural livestock monitoring data sources has been created and exposed via an API server:
   - Farm Management Software: Granular, Trimble Ag, Climate FieldView
   - Livestock Health Records: Zoetis, Merck Animal Health, Elanco
   - Weather Data: The Weather Company, AccuWeather, DTN

2. **Custom Data Integration**: A custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK communicates with the API server to extract the synthetic agriculture livestock data

3. **Automated Data Movement**: Fivetran manages the orchestration and scheduling of data movement from the API server into Snowflake

4. **Data Loading**: The synthetic agriculture data is loaded into Snowflake as an `AGR_RECORDS` table in a structured format ready for analysis

5. **Data Analysis**: Snowpark for Python and Snowflake Cortex analyze the data to generate insights

6. **Data Visualization**: Streamlit in Snowflake presents the analyzed data in an interactive data application

## Data Requirements

The application expects a table named `AGR_RECORDS` which contains synthetic data simulating various agricultural livestock monitoring systems. This data is retrieved from an API server using a custom Fivetran connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK:

### Livestock Data
- `record_id`
- `animal_id`
- `farm_id`
- `species`
- `breed`
- `health_status`
- `vaccination_history`
- `medication_history`
- `recommended_action`

### Performance Metrics
- `age`
- `weight`
- `predicted_health_risk`
- `temperature`
- `humidity`
- `precipitation`
- `weather_data`

## Benefits

- **300 fewer failed treatments per year**: 10,000 animals √ó 3% baseline treatment failure rate √ó 10% reduction = 300 fewer failed treatments/year
- **$1,200,000 in reduced veterinary costs annually**: $4,000,000 annual veterinary costs √ó 30% reduction = $1,200,000 savings/year
- **20% increase in animal productivity**: 80,000 animals √ó 20% baseline productivity rate √ó 20% improvement = 32,000 additional units/year
- **15% reduction in antibiotic usage**: 10,000 animals √ó 15% baseline antibiotic usage rate √ó 15% reduction = 1,500 fewer antibiotic treatments/year

## Technical Details
