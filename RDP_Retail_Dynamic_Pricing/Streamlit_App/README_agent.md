A Fivetran and Cortex-powered Streamlit in Snowflake data application for Retail with advanced AI Agent Workflows.

## Overview

PricePulse is an AI-driven dynamic pricing system that helps retailers maximize profits through real-time price optimization. This Streamlit in Snowflake data application helps pricing managers, inventory managers, and marketing teams respond quickly to market fluctuations, reducing overstocking and stockouts while increasing revenue and customer satisfaction.

The application features sophisticated AI Agent Workflows that provide transparent, step-by-step analysis of retail pricing data, transforming complex market insights into actionable pricing strategies and revenue optimization recommendations. Each analysis focus area operates through specialized mini-agents that simulate the decision-making process of experienced retail pricing professionals and merchandising specialists.

The application utilizes a synthetic retail dataset that simulates data from point of sale systems, customer relationship management platforms, and inventory management systems. This synthetic data is moved into Snowflake using a custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK, enabling reliable and efficient data pipelines for retail analytics.
