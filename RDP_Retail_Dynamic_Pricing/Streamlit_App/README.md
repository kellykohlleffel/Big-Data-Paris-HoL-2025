![PricePulse](images/PricePulse.png)

A Fivetran and Cortex-powered Streamlit in Snowflake data application for Retail.

## Overview

PricePulse is an AI-driven dynamic pricing system that helps retailers maximize profits through real-time price optimization. This Streamlit in Snowflake data application helps pricing managers, inventory managers, and marketing teams respond quickly to market fluctuations, reducing overstocking and stockouts while increasing revenue and customer satisfaction.

The application utilizes a synthetic retail dataset that simulates data from point of sale systems, customer relationship management platforms, and inventory management systems. This synthetic data is moved into Snowflake using a custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK, enabling reliable and efficient data pipelines for retail analytics.

## Data Sources

The application is designed to work with data from major retail systems and platforms:

### Retail Data Sources (Simulated)
- **Point of Sale (POS)**: 
  - Shopify
  - Square
  - Lightspeed
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**: 
  - Salesforce
  - HubSpot
  - Zoho
- **Inventory Management**: 
  - Manhattan Associates
  - Oracle Retail
  - JDA Software

For demonstration and development purposes, we've created a synthetic dataset that approximates these data sources and combined them into a single table exposed through an API server. This approach allows for realistic retail analytics without using protected customer information.

## Key Features

- **Real-time market data analysis**: Analyzes sales data, market trends, and competitive information to inform pricing decisions
- **Predictive demand forecasting**: Predicts future demand based on historical data and market factors
- **Automated price optimization**: Automatically recommends optimal pricing for products based on multiple factors
- **Integration with synthetic retail data**: Simulates data from major POS, CRM, and inventory management systems
- **Comprehensive data application**: Visual representation of key metrics including revenue growth, stockout rates, overstock rates, and customer satisfaction
- **AI-powered insights**: Generate in-depth analysis of overall performance, optimization opportunities, financial impact, and strategic recommendations
- **Custom Fivetran connector**: Utilizes a custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK to reliably move data from the API server to Snowflake

## Setup Instructions

1. Within Snowflake, click on **Projects**
2. Click on **Streamlit**
3. Click the blue box in the upper right to create a new Streamlit application
4. On the next page:
   - Name your application
   - **IMPORTANT:** Set the database context
   - **IMPORTANT:** Set the schema context

### Fivetran Data Movement Setup

1. Ensure the API server hosting the synthetic retail data is operational
2. Configure the custom Fivetran connector (built with Fivetran Connector SDK) to connect to the API server - debug and deploy
3. Start the Fivetran sync in the Fivetran UI to move data into an `RDP_RECORDS` table in your Snowflake instance
4. Verify data is being loaded correctly by checking the table in Snowflake

## Data Flow

1. **Synthetic Data Creation**: A synthetic dataset approximating real retail data sources has been created and exposed via an API server:
   - Point of Sale: Shopify, Square, Lightspeed
   - Customer Relationship Management: Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho
   - Inventory Management: Manhattan Associates, Oracle Retail, JDA Software

2. **Custom Data Integration**: A custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK communicates with the API server to extract the synthetic retail data

3. **Automated Data Movement**: Fivetran manages the orchestration and scheduling of data movement from the API server into Snowflake

4. **Data Loading**: The synthetic retail data is loaded into Snowflake as an `RDP_RECORDS` table in a structured format ready for analysis

5. **Data Analysis**: Snowpark for Python and Snowflake Cortex analyze the data to generate insights

6. **Data Visualization**: Streamlit in Snowflake presents the analyzed data in an interactive data application

## Data Requirements

The application expects a table named `RDP_RECORDS` which contains synthetic data simulating various retail systems. This data is retrieved from an API server using a custom Fivetran connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK:

### Order and Customer Data
- `order_id`
- `order_date`
- `order_total`
- `order_status`
- `customer_id`
- `customer_segment`
- `customer_ltv`
- `order_frequency`
- `average_order_value`

### Product Data
- `product_id`
- `product_category`
- `product_subcategory`
- `product_price`
- `product_rating`
- `product_review_count`

### Pricing Metrics
- `price_elasticity`
- `price_optimization_date`
- `price_optimization_result`
- `price_optimization_recommendation`

### Inventory Data
- `inventory_level`
- `inventory_turnover`
- `stockout_rate`
- `overstock_rate`
- `demand_forecast`

### Performance Metrics
- `revenue_growth_rate`
- `customer_satisfaction_rate`

## Benefits

- 8% increase in revenue: $800,000 additional revenue/year
- 12% reduction in overstocking: $60,000 savings/year
- 10% decrease in stockouts: $20,000 savings/year
