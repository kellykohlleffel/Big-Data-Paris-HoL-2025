# Manufacturing MSO Fivetran Custom Connector

This connector uses the Fivetran Connector SDK to extract Manufacturing Material Supply Optimization (MSO) data from an API and load it into Snowflake via Fivetran, powering advanced manufacturing analytics applications.

## Overview

The Manufacturing MSO connector fetches material optimization records from a REST API and loads them into a single table called `mso_records` in your Snowflake database. The connector retrieves detailed information about material selection and optimization for manufacturing products, including properties like material characteristics, product performance metrics, cost savings, and design parameters. It handles authentication, pagination, error handling, and maintains state between sync runs using a cursor-based approach.

## Features

- **Incremental syncs**: Uses cursor-based pagination to efficiently process data in chunks
- **State management**: Tracks sync progress and saves checkpoints every 100 records
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles API and runtime errors with detailed logging
- **Configuration management**: Customizable API endpoint, page size, and authentication
- **Minimal permissions**: Requires only an API key to access the MSO data
- **Data enrichment**: Extracts over 30 metrics and attributes related to manufacturing material optimization
- **Efficient processing**: Handles large datasets (600+ records) with minimal resource usage
- **Manufacturing-specific**: Designed to handle material data common in manufacturing operations

## Implementation Details

### Schema Definition

The connector defines a simple schema with a single table `mso_records` and specifies `record_id` as the primary key.

```python
def schema(configuration: dict):
    # Return minimal schema with ONLY table name and primary key
    return [
        {
            "table": "mso_records",
            "primary_key": ["record_id"]
        }
    ]
```

### Data Extraction

The connector follows a structured approach to extract data:

1. **Configuration validation**: Retrieves and validates the API key, base URL and page size
2. **Session setup**: Creates an authenticated session with the API key in the header
3. **State management**: Loads previous sync state to determine where to resume from
4. **Pagination handling**: Implements cursor-based pagination to fetch data in batches
5. **Data processing**: Yields upsert operations for each record to be loaded into Fivetran
6. **Checkpoint creation**: Saves checkpoints after every 100 records to ensure reliability
7. **Error handling**: Catches and logs API exceptions and unexpected errors

The connector uses this workflow to efficiently process large datasets while maintaining resiliency against failures.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.7+ installed
2. The Fivetran Connector SDK installed:
   ```bash
   pip install fivetran-connector-sdk
   ```
3. DuckDB command-line tool (optional, for viewing debug output)
4. Basic understanding of the Fivetran platform

### Local Development and Testing

1. Clone or create the project directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir mso && cd mso
   ```

2. Create the required files:
   - `configuration.json`: Configure your API credentials and settings
   - `connector.py`: Implement the connector using the Fivetran SDK
   - `debug_and_reset.sh`: Script for testing
   - `deploy.sh`: Script for deployment

3. Make the scripts executable and run the debug script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x debug_and_reset.sh
   ./debug_and_reset.sh
   ```

   This will:
   - Reset the connector state
   - Run the connector in debug mode
   - Display sample data from the extracted records
   - Show operation statistics

### Debug Script Details

The `debug_and_reset.sh` script includes the following steps:

1. **Validation**: Checks for required files and extracts the table name
2. **Reset**: Clears previous state and data using `fivetran reset`
3. **Debug**: Runs the connector in debug mode with the specified configuration
4. **Query**: Executes a sample query against the extracted data using DuckDB

### Deploying to Fivetran

1. Ensure you have a Fivetran account and destination configured

2. Make the deploy script executable and run it:
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

3. When prompted, enter:
   - Your Fivetran account name (default: MDS_SNOWFLAKE_HOL)
   - Your Fivetran destination name (default: NEW_SALES_ENG_HANDS_ON_LAB)
   - A unique name for your connector (e.g., a_new_mso_connector)

4. The script will package and upload your connector to Fivetran

### Deploy Script Details

The `deploy.sh` script performs the following actions:

1. **Configuration Check**: Validates that the necessary configuration files are present
2. **Account Information**: Prompts for Fivetran account details and retrieves API key
3. **Deployment**: Packages and uploads the connector to your Fivetran account
4. **Confirmation**: Displays the connector ID and a link to access it in the Fivetran dashboard

Sample output from a successful deployment:
```
Deploying connector...
✓ Packaging your project for upload...
✓ Uploading your project...
The connection 'a_new_mso_connector' has been created successfully.
Python Version: 3.12.8
Connection ID: spleen_divide
Visit the Fivetran dashboard to start the initial sync: https://fivetran.com/dashboard/connectors/spleen_divide/status
```

### What to Expect After Deployment

After successful deployment:

1. The connector will be created in your Fivetran account with a randomly generated Connection ID (e.g., `spleen_divide`)
2. You'll be provided a link to access the connector in the Fivetran dashboard
3. The connector will be ready for its initial sync

In the Fivetran dashboard, you will be able to:
- View your connector's sync status
- Configure sync frequency (hourly, daily, etc.)
- Monitor for any errors or warnings
- View the destination schema with the `mso_records` table in Snowflake
- Track the data volume and record count
- Configure schema and field mapping if needed

The first sync will extract all available data, while subsequent syncs will be incremental, only fetching new or changed records based on the stored cursor position.

## Maintenance and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **API Key Issues**: Ensure your API key is valid and has the correct permissions
- **Network Connectivity**: Check that your network can reach the MSO API endpoint
- **Schema Changes**: If the API changes its schema, you may need to update the connector
- **Cursor Issues**: If the cursor becomes invalid, reset the connector to perform a full sync
- **Memory Limitations**: For very large datasets, consider decreasing the page size

### Monitoring

- Check the Fivetran dashboard for sync status and errors
- Review logs in the Fivetran dashboard for detailed error information
- Use the debug script locally to test changes before deployment
- Monitor the timestamps of the most recent records to ensure data freshness

### Debug and Reset

If you encounter issues with the connector, you can use the debug_and_reset.sh script to:

1. Reset the connector state (start fresh)
2. Run in debug mode to see detailed logs
3. Inspect the sample data to verify correct data extraction
4. Check operation statistics to ensure proper functioning

The script outputs detailed information that can help diagnose issues:
- API request parameters and response details
- Error messages and stack traces
- Operation counts (upserts, updates, deletes, etc.)
- Checkpoint state information

## Advanced Customization

To extend or modify this connector:

### Adding New Fields

1. If the MSO API adds new fields, you can capture them automatically. Since the connector uses the entire record for upserts, new fields will be included without schema changes.

2. To add transformations or derived fields:
   ```python
   # Example of adding a derived field in the update function
   for record in records:
       # Add a derived field based on existing data
       record['efficiency_ratio'] = record['performance_improvement'] / record['material_cost'] if record['material_cost'] > 0 else 0
       yield op.upsert("mso_records", record)
   ```

### Supporting Multiple Tables

1. Update the schema function to define additional tables:
   ```python
   def schema(configuration: dict):
       return [
           {
               "table": "mso_records",
               "primary_key": ["record_id"]
           },
           {
               "table": "mso_products",
               "primary_key": ["product_id"]
           }
       ]
   ```

2. Modify the update function to yield operations for multiple tables:
   ```python
   # Example: Creating product records from MSO data
   product_records = {}
   for record in records:
       # Extract product info for separate table
       product_id = record['product_id']
       if product_id not in product_records:
           product_records[product_id] = {
               'product_id': product_id,
               'product_name': record['product_name'],
               'product_description': record['product_description'],
               'product_lifecycle_stage': record['product_lifecycle_stage'],
               'product_lifecycle_status': record['product_lifecycle_status']
           }
       # Yield the original record
       yield op.upsert("mso_records", record)
   
   # Yield all unique product records
   for product in product_records.values():
       yield op.upsert("mso_products", product)
   ```

### Dependencies Management

To add external dependencies:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory
2. Add your dependencies, for example:
   ```
   requests>=2.25.0
   python-dateutil>=2.8.1
   ```
3. The Fivetran deployment process will automatically install these dependencies in the connector environment
