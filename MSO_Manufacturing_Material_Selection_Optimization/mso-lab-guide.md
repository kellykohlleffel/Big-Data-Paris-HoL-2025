# Fivetran Connector SDK Hands on Lab at Big Data London 2025: Manufacturing Material Supply Optimization

## Overview
In this 20-minute hands on lab, you'll build a **custom Fivetran connector** using the **Fivetran Connector SDK** and the **Anthropic Workbench** to integrate manufacturing material optimization data from a custom REST API into Snowflake. You'll then create a **Streamlit in Snowflake** application powering manufacturing metrics and **Snowflake Cortex AI-driven** material selection and optimization applications.

The Manufacturing MSO custom connector should fetch material optimization records from a REST API and load them into a single table called `mso_records` in your Snowflake database. The connector should deliver detailed information about material selection and optimization for manufacturing products, including properties like material characteristics, product performance metrics, cost savings, and design parameters. It should handle authentication, pagination, error handling, and maintain state between sync runs using a cursor-based approach.

## Step 1: Create a Custom Connector with the Fivetran Connector SDK (8 minutes)

### 1.1 Generate the Custom Connector Code Using AI Code Generation Assistance
1. Switch to **Chrome Tab 2 (Anthropic Workbench)**
2. Copy and paste the following **User prompt** into the workbench:

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand the User prompt and click the Copy icon in the right corner</summary>

```
- Provide a custom connector for Manufacturing for the mso_data endpoint. 1 table called mso_records - all columns.  
- Make sure you copy the configuration.json file exactly - do not add any other variables to it.
- Here is the API spec: https://sdk-demo-api-dot-internal-sales.uc.r.appspot.com/mso_api_spec
```
</details>

3. Click the black **Run** button in the upper right
4. After Claude generates the connector.py code, you will see a response similar to the example connector, but updated for the manufacturing material optimization dataset.
5. Click [mso_data](https://sdk-demo-api-dot-internal-sales.uc.r.appspot.com/mso_data) if you'd like to see the dataset.

### 1.2 Debug and Deploy the Custom Connector in VS Code
1. When you see the connector.py code generated in the Anthropic Workbench, click the **Copy** button in the upper right of the code connector.py code block
2. Go to **VS Code** with Command + Tab or open from the dock
3. Click on the `connector.py` file in your project
4. Press Command+V to paste the connector code into the `connector.py` file
5. Save the updated `connector.py` by pressing Command+S
6. To test your code locally with configuration values specified in `configuration.json`, you can run the default Fivetran Connector SDK debug command:  
   `fivetran debug --configuration configuration.json`  
   This command provides out-of-the-box debugging without any additional scripting. 
7. We have created a helper script to debug and validate your connector with enhanced logging, state clearing and data validation. To run the helper script please run it in the VS Code terminal (bottom right). You can copy the `debug_and_validate` command using the icon on the right:

```
./debug_and_validate.sh
```

8. When prompted with "Do you want to continue? (Y/N):", type `Y` and press Enter.

    - You'll see output displaying the results of the debug script including:

        - Resets the connector state by deleting the existing warehouse.db file and any saved sync checkpoints to start with a clean slate.

        - Runs the fivetran debug command using your configuration file to test the connector in real time.(debug emulates a regular Fivetran sync where the schema() and update() methods are called).

        - Excute the Custom `Connector.py` code you wrote fetching data and executing pagination and checkpoint saving for incremental sync as per your custom code and the current state variable. The helper script emulates an initial full sync.

        - Verifies data loading and schema creation by simulating a full sync (in this case, upserting 750 records into mso_records).

        - Queries and displays sample records from the resulting DuckDB table to confirm the connector outputs expected data.

9. Fivetran provides a built-in command to deploy your connector directly using the SDK:  
   `fivetran deploy --api-key <BASE64_API_KEY> --destination <DESTINATION_NAME> --connection <CONNECTION_NAME>`  
   This command deploys your code to Fivetran and creates or updates the connection. If the connection already exists, it prompts you before overwriting.  
   You can also provide additional optional parameters:  
   - `--configuration` to pass configuration values  
   - `--force` to bypass confirmation prompts, great for CI/CD uses  
   - `--python-version` to specify Python runtime  
   - `--hybrid-deployment-agent-id` for non-default hybrid agent selection  

10. To simplify the lab experience, we’ve created a helper script that wraps the deploy logic. Run the following command in the VS Code terminal (copy the command using the icon in the right corner):

```
./deploy.sh
```

11. Click enter twice to accept the default values for the Fivetran Account Name and the Fivetran Destination. When prompted for the **connection name**, type in:

```
manufacturing_mso_connector
```

12. Press Enter to deploy your new custom connector to Fivetran.

## Step 2: Start Data Sync in Fivetran (3 minutes)

1. Switch to **Chrome Tab 3 (Fivetran Automated Data Movement)**
2. Refresh the page and find your newly created connection named "manufacturing-mso-connector" in the connections list
3. Click on the connection to open the **Status** page
4. Click the **Start Initial Sync** button
5. You should see a status message indicating that the sync is **Active** and that it is the first time syncing data for this connection.
6. Once your sync completes, you will see a message "Next sync will run in x hours" and if you click on the **1 HOUR** selection on the right side, you will see some sync metrics.
    * You may need to refresh the UI to see updated sync progress and logs in the UI. 
7. Once your sync completes, you will see a message "Next sync will run in x hours" and if you click on the **1 HOUR** selection on the right side, you will see some sync metrics.

## Step 3: Create a Streamlit in Snowflake Gen AI Data App (5 minutes)

### 3.1 Copy the Streamlit Data App Code
1. Copy the Streamlit code below (click the Copy icon in the right corner)

### 3.2 Create and Deploy the Streamlit in Snowflake Gen AI Data App
1. Switch to **Chrome Tab 4 (Snowflake UI)**
2. Click on **Projects** in the left navigation panel
3. Click on **Streamlit**
4. Click the **+ Streamlit App** blue button in the upper right corner
5. Configure your app:
   - App title: `MaterialMind`
   - Database: Select `SF_LABUSER#_DB` (only option available for your user)
   - Schema: Select `manufacturing_mso_connector` the schema created by your Fivetran connector (this should be the only schema available other than Public - do not select Public)
6. In the Streamlit Editor that appears (left side of the Streamlit UI), select all text (Command+A) and delete it
7. Paste the copied Streamlit application code into the empty editor (Command+V):
8. Click the blue **Run** button in the upper right corner
9. Close the editor by clicking the middle icon in the bottom left navigation

### 3.3 Explore the Streamlit in Snowflake Gen AI Data App
The MaterialMind data app should now be running with the following sections:
- **Metrics**: View weight reduction, cost savings, performance improvement, and waste reduction metrics
- **AI Insights**: Generate AI-powered analysis of the material optimization data across four focus areas
- **Insights History**: Access previously generated AI insights
- **Data Explorer**: Browse the underlying data

## Done!
You've successfully:
1. Created a custom Fivetran connector using the Fivetran Connector SDK
2. Deployed the connector to sync manufacturing material optimization data into Snowflake
3. Built a Streamlit in Snowflake data app to visualize and analyze the data using Snowflake Cortex

## Next Steps
Consider how you might adapt this solution for your own use:
- Integration with material databases like MatWeb, Granta Design, or Material Properties Database
- Adding real-time material property monitoring from manufacturing systems
- Implementing machine learning models for more sophisticated material selection algorithms
- Customizing the Streamlit app for specific manufacturing processes
