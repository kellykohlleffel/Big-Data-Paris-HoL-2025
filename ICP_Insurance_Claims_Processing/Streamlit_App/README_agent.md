A Fivetran and Cortex-powered Streamlit in Snowflake data application for Insurance with advanced AI Agent Workflows.

## Overview

ClaimSphere is an AI-driven claims processing automation system that helps insurance companies transform manual claims handling into a streamlined, efficient process. This Streamlit in Snowflake data application helps claims managers, underwriters, and customer service representatives reduce processing time, minimize errors, and improve customer satisfaction through real-time analysis of claims data.

The application features sophisticated AI Agent Workflows that provide transparent, step-by-step analysis of insurance claims data, transforming complex claims processing insights into actionable operational strategies and customer service improvements. Each analysis focus area operates through specialized mini-agents that simulate the decision-making process of experienced claims adjusters and insurance operations professionals.

The application utilizes a synthetic insurance dataset that simulates data from major claims management systems, policy administration systems, and CRM platforms. This synthetic data is moved into Snowflake using a custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK, enabling reliable and efficient data pipelines for insurance analytics.
