A Fivetran and Cortex-powered Streamlit in Snowflake data application for Pharmaceutical Clinical Trials with advanced AI Agent Workflows.

## Overview

TrialGenius is an AI-powered clinical trial design and optimization system that helps pharmaceutical companies automate the manual and time-consuming process of analyzing clinical trial protocols, patient enrollment data, and trial performance metrics. This Streamlit in Snowflake data application helps Chief Medical Officers, Clinical Operations Directors, and VP of Clinical Development reduce trial failure rates, decrease development costs, minimize enrollment delays, and accelerate patient recruitment through real-time analysis of clinical trial data.

The application features sophisticated AI Agent Workflows that provide transparent, step-by-step analysis of clinical trial data, transforming complex protocol designs and patient recruitment strategies into actionable clinical insights and adaptive trial recommendations. Each analysis focus area operates through specialized mini-agents that simulate the decision-making process of experienced clinical operations professionals and trial design experts.

The application utilizes a synthetic pharmaceutical dataset that simulates data from clinical trial management systems (CTMS), electronic data capture (EDC) platforms, and real-world evidence databases. This synthetic data is moved into Snowflake using a custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK, enabling reliable and efficient data pipelines for pharmaceutical clinical trial analytics.
