![ProjectFlow AI](images/ProjectFlow.png)

A Fivetran and Cortex-powered Streamlit in Snowflake data application for Construction Schedule Optimization.

## Overview

ProjectFlow AI is an intelligent construction schedule optimization system that helps construction companies automate the complex and time-consuming process of creating accurate project schedules across multiple time horizons. This Streamlit in Snowflake data application helps Chief Operating Officers, Project Managers, and construction directors reduce project delays, minimize cost overruns, optimize resource allocation, and improve schedule performance through real-time analysis of project management, resource allocation, and operational data.

The application utilizes a synthetic construction dataset that simulates data from project management platforms, enterprise resource planning systems, weather forecasting services, and equipment management databases. This synthetic data is moved into Snowflake using a custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK, enabling reliable and efficient data pipelines for construction schedule optimization analytics.

## Data Sources

The application is designed to work with data from major construction and project management systems:

### Construction Data Sources (Simulated)
- **Project Management Platforms**: 
  - Microsoft Project
  - Primavera P6
  - Smartsheet
- **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)**: 
  - SAP
  - Oracle Construction and Engineering
  - Sage 300 CRE
- **Weather Forecasting**: 
  - The Weather Channel

- **Supply Chain Management**: 
  - Oracle SCM
  - SAP Ariba
  - Coupa
- **Equipment Management**:

  - HCSS Equipment360
  - Fleetio

For demonstration and development purposes, we've created a synthetic dataset that approximates these data sources and combined them into a single table exposed through an API server. This approach allows for realistic construction schedule optimization analytics without using proprietary project management data.

## Setup Instructions

1. Within Snowflake, click on **Projects**
2. Click on **Streamlit**
3. Click the blue box in the upper right to create a new Streamlit application
4. On the next page:
   - Name your application
   - **IMPORTANT:** Set the database context
   - **IMPORTANT:** Set the schema context

### Fivetran Data Movement Setup

1. Ensure the API server hosting the synthetic construction data is operational
2. Configure the custom Fivetran connector (built with Fivetran Connector SDK) to connect to the API server - debug and deploy
3. Start the Fivetran sync in the Fivetran UI to move data into a `CON_RECORDS` table in your Snowflake instance
4. Verify data is being loaded correctly by checking the table in Snowflake

## Data Flow

1. **Synthetic Data Creation**: A synthetic dataset approximating real construction project management data sources has been created and exposed via an API server:
   - Project Management Platforms: Microsoft Project, Primavera P6, Smartsheet
   - Enterprise Resource Planning: SAP, Oracle Construction and Engineering, Sage 300 CRE
   - Weather Forecasting: The Weather Channel, DTN, Weatherzone

2. **Custom Data Integration**: A custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK communicates with the API server to extract the synthetic construction project management data

3. **Automated Data Movement**: Fivetran manages the orchestration and scheduling of data movement from the API server into Snowflake

4. **Data Loading**: The synthetic construction data is loaded into Snowflake as a `CON_RECORDS` table in a structured format ready for analysis

5. **Data Analysis**: Snowpark for Python and Snowflake Cortex analyze the data to generate insights

6. **Data Visualization**: Streamlit in Snowflake presents the analyzed data in an interactive data application
